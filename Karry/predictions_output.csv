number of round nodular densities projecting over each upper lung, but more
numerous and discretely visualized in the left upper lobe, similar to prior

FINDINGS: 

There is background hyperinflation, suggesting background COPD.  There is
probable mild cardiomegaly.  Aorta is minimally unfolded.  Mild prominence of
the hila with a tapered appearance could reflect pulmonary hypertension.

There is possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but no evidence of CHF. 
No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.

There is a curvilinear lucency projecting over the right upper lung between
the right posterior fourth and fifth ribs.  Although this raises the
possibility of a right upper pneumothorax, vessels are seen projecting beyond
it and this more likely represents artifact due to skin fold.  There is no
associated atelectasis.

Rounded lucency projecting between the anterior fourth and fifth ribs most
likely reflects rib synostosis.  A finding in the lateral right mid lung is
considered less likely.

Abutting the lower left chest wall, overlying the left anterior seventh rib,
there is a 3.8 mm nodular opacity, possibly a small pulmonary nodule.

IMPRESSION: 

Suspect background COPD, with possible pulmonary hypertension.

Mild cardiomegaly.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected.

Curvilinear lucency at right lung apex more likely represents a skin fold than
a pneumothorax.  Clinical correlation is requested.  If there is clinical
concern for pneumothorax, a repeat film, obtained at end expiration of the
respiratory cycle could help for further assessment.

Probable normal variant or old posttraumatic synostosis of the right fourth

HISTORY:  Fractured hip.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS:  No focal consolidation or superimposed edema is noted.  There is
aortic tortuosity with calcified plaque noted throughout.  The cardiac
silhouette is top normal for size accounting for patient and technical
factors.  While relatively symmetric ill-defined nodular densities project at
the respective costophrenic angles on one of the submitted views, a second
frontal radiograph obtained to include the right costophrenic angle is less
revealing.  The densities projecting over the costophrenic angles likely are
nipple shadows.  Repeat studies with nipple markers are likely indicated to
exclude underlying pulmonary nodule.  There are low lung volumes with linear
atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is minimal blunting of the left
costophrenic angle which may indicate a small pleural effusion.  No right
effusion is noted.  There is no pneumothorax.  Deformity of multiple posterior
right ribs suggest prior trauma since healed.  No acute fractures are noted.

IMPRESSION:  Ill-defined nodular densities are  relatively symmetric in the
lung bases and presumed nipple shadows.  Follow up x-rays should be performed
with nipple markers to help confirm this.  There is a small left pleural
effusion with otherwise no acute pulmonary process noted.

some retraction superiorly,  and slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm.
This apparently corresponds to a previous radiofrequency ablation site, with
chronic fibrotic changes.  A single clip is noted nearby.

On the right, there is focal opacity at the right lung apex, extending
medially to the right paratracheal soft tissue. This is similar to the scout
film from the ___ CT scan and likely corresponds to the right upper
posterior mediastinal mass identified on that CT scan.

There may be minimal atelectasis at both bases. However, otherwise, no focal
opacity to suggest acute pneumonic infiltrate or site of aspiration is
identified. No pneumothorax is detected.

Small pulmonary nodules identified on CT scan are not apparent

Although an infectious infiltrate or area of aspiration pneumonitis cannot be
entirely excluded, the appearance is more suggestive of atelectasis.

Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation.  Bilateral apices are
partially obscured.

Probable mild cardiomegaly.

Calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, consistent with prior
granulomatous disease.

Small focal density at the right base laterally is partially obscured by
surrounding effusion and atelectasis.  Attention to this area on followup
films is recommended to exclude a focal nodule or  calcified granuloma.



RECOMMENDATIONS:  Small focal density at the right base laterally is partially
obscured by surrounding effusion and atelectasis. Attention to this area on

COMPARISON:  Targeted review of chest CT from ___ and PET-CT from

FINDINGS: 

Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal silhouette is
probably grossly unchanged compared with ___ chest CT scout film.

Opacity in the right upper zone is compatible with the known right upper lobe
mass.  Right middle lobe nodule may correspond to some faint opacity in the
right perihilar region.

The lateral view is obtained supine and there is some artifact due to
overlying materials.  There is patchy increased density in lower zone
posteriorly, without definite correlate on the frontal views.  There is
minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base.

Minimal pleural thickening at the base of the left chest wall, but no gross
effusion.  This appearance is in keeping with findings on the ___
CT scan.

Eventration of right hemidiaphragm again noted.  Surgical clips again seen in
the superior mediastinum and upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION: 

Opacity in the right upper lobe is likely accounted for by known right upper
lobe pulmonary neoplasm.  Opacity in the right mid zone is likely accounted
for by known right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.

Allowing for this, no definite focal infiltrate.  However, on the lateral
view, there is increased density projecting over the lower lobes and the
possibility of a subtle infiltrate posteriorly is difficult to exclude.
Admittedly, much of this may be accounted for by artifact and atelectasis.  If
possible, a lateral view with the patient upright and with good inspiratory
effort may be useful for further assessment.

FINDINGS: 

The lungs are adequately expanded bilaterally.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette, hila, and pleural surfaces are normal.  There is no sign of
pulmonary edema and the lungs show no consolidation.  However there is a small
round opacity in the right upper lobe, which may represent a pulmonary nodule

since ___, but the consolidative lesion inferior to the large metastasis in
the left midlung is bigger today than it was 3 days ago.  This combination can
be explained by either focal pulmonary hemorrhage or infection and improvement

directed medially in the upper mediastinum with a location that is highly
suggestive of intrafissural placement.  There is increased lucency at the lung
base, particularly outlining the right hemidiaphragm, which likely indicates a
residual component of the pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.  As before, the aortic arch
and descending aorta are markedly enlarged.  On today's study, a  TAVR is
present.  Probable background hyperinflation/COPD again noted.

As before, there is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the
left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
consolidation and blunting of left costophrenic angle.  Lucency overlying the
cardiac silhouette is not fully characterized, but is similar to the prior
study, question due to hiatal hernia.

There is minimal atelectasis the right base, with possible trace blunting the
right costophrenic angle, without significant change.

Focal patchy opacity in the left suprahilar region is noted, slightly more
pronounced.


IMPRESSION: 

Apparent interval placement of TAVR.  As before, the aortic arch and
descending aorta are markedly enlarged.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly
unchanged.

Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with probable small left
effusion, unchanged.  Atelectasis and possible minimal pleural fluid at right,
but similar to prior.

Lucency overlying the cardiac silhouette of uncertain etiology or
significance, but unchanged.  Question related to hiatal hernia.  If
clinically indicated, a lateral view could help for further assessment.

Patchy opacity left upper zone is less pronounced.  On the current exam, there
are 2 small nodular densities in this area.  These could represent residual
infiltrate, though raise the possibility of small pulmonary nodules. 
Attention to this area on followup films is recommended to confirm resolution.

RECOMMENDATION(S):  Patchy opacity left upper zone is less pronounced.  On the
current exam, there are 2 small nodular densities in this area.  These could
represent residual infiltrate, though raise the possibility of small pulmonary
nodules. Attention to this area on followup films is recommended to confirm

although acute focal consolidation cannot be excluded.  A subtle rounded
opacity in the right upper lobe, measuring approximately 1.1 cm is seen and
pulmonary nodule is of concern.  It is difficult to ascertain whether it is
calcified or not.  Dedicated non-emergent chest CT is recommended for further
evaluation.  At least two foci of rounded lucency in the retrocardiac region
are seen which are likely due to hiatal hernia.  The left lung is clear.  The
aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in
size.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There is diffuse osteopenia, which
limits evaluation for subtle fractures.  Given this, no displaced fracture is
seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Subtle right upper lobe nodular opacity, difficult to ascertain whether
calcified.  Recommend dedicated chest CT for further evaluation.
2.  Medial right lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis or chronic
changes, although consolidation not excluded.  This can be further evaluated
on the recommended CT.
3.  Hiatal hernia.
4.  Diffuse osteopenia makes evaluation for subtle fractures suboptimal; given
this no displaced fracture seen.

earlier in the day.  The tip of the newly-placed ET tube lies some 4.3 cm
proximal to the carina and the distal portion of the endogastric tube is
poorly seen, but appears to lie in the gastric fundus and directed cephalad,
and a right IJ central venous catheter has apparently been partially
withdrawn, with its tip projected over the proximal SVC, and no supine
evidence of pneumothorax.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and
CABG with six intact sternal cerclage wires.  There are patchy streaky
opacities in the right mid lung and both lung bases, likely atelectasis. There
is diffuse, ill-defined prominence of interstitial markings, which may
represent edema.
