FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperexpanded likely due to underlying obstructive lung disease.  No consolidation or edema is evident.  There is a subtle nodular density projecting along the inferior margin of the anterior right fourth rib.  There may be a similar structure along the same horizontal line project in the left chest which would then most likely render this nipple shadow.
